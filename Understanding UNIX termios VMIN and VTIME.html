<p>
The POSIX "termios" structures are at the center of serial-port I/O
control, and there are <i>many</i> knobs and switches to turn here. The
<b>stty</b> program is actually a command-line wrapper around the <b>termios</b>
struct, and it should be apparent that this whole arena is filled with
arcana, obscura, historical artifacts, and even nostalgia.
</p>

<p>
A single Tech Tip can't possible cover them all, but it can at least
touch on one area of common confusion: the use of <b>VMIN</b> and <b>VTIME</b>.
These are macros used as indexes into the <b>termios.c_cc[]</b>
array, which under normal circumstances holds the list of special
<i>control characters</i> (backspace, erase, line kill, interrupt, etc.)
for the current session.
</p>

<p>
But when the <b>ICANON</b> bit is turned off, a "raw mode" is selected which
changes the interpretation of these values. These are used to guide the
line-driver code in its decision on allowing the <b>read()</b> system call to
return.  We'll try to explain them in some detail.
</p>

<p class="topnote">
NOTE: This is <b>not</b> a tutorial on <b>termios</b> programming as a
whole. This is a very large subject, and the only way to present a Tech
Tip on a subject is to presume that the reader understands the subject
in general.
</p>

<p>
An excellent resource is the dated but still timely book
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/posix/index.html">POSIX
Programmer's Guide</a> by Donald Lewine (O'Reilly &amp; Associates). This
covers terminal I/O quite well, along with other important POSIX topics (process
control, signals, etc.). Highly recommended.
</p>

<h1>Who cares about timing?</h1>

<p>
Unlike reading from a file, where data are either "present" or
"not present", there are also <i>timing issues</i> involved in reading from
a tty channel.  Many programs won't care about this at all, but there
are some important cases where this is vital to correct operation.
</p>

<dl class="defnlist">
<dt>Function-key processing
</dt>

<dd>On a regular keyboard, most keys send just one byte each, but
almost all keyboards have special keys that send a <i>sequence of characters</i>
at a time. Examples (from an ANSI keyboard)
</dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>ESC [ A</tt></b>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up arrow </li>
<li><b><tt>ESC [ 5 ~</tt></b>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; page up </li>
<li><b><tt>ESC [ 18 ~</tt></b> &nbsp;&nbsp; F7 </li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
and so on.
</dd>

<dd>
From a strictly "string recognition" point of view, it's easy
enough to translate "<b>ESC [ A</b>" into "up arrow" inside a program,
but how does it tell the difference between "user typed up-arrow"
and "user typed the ESCAPE key"? The difference is <i>timing</i>.
If the ESCAPE is <i>immediately</i> followed by the rest of the
expected sequence, then it's a function key: otherwise it's just
a plain ESCAPE.
</dd>

<dt>
Efficient highspeed input
</dt>

<dd>When a communications program (such as fax software) is reading
from a modem, the data stream is arriving at a relatively high rate.
Doing single-character-at-a-time input would be extremely inefficient,
given that each <b>read()</b> involves a system call and an operating
system context switch.
We'd instead like to read in larger chunk if it's available for us, but
still know how to recognize timeouts (which usually indicate error
conditions).
</dd>

<dt>
Capturing occasional, low-volume data
</dt>
<dd>When writing software that monitored a temperature sensor via
a serial line, we expected to receive a short (10-20 bytes)
message every second. This message arrived as a single burst, and
once the first character of the message was received, we <i>knew</i>
that the others were right behind it and would be completely received
in about 100 milliseconds.
</dd>

<dd>
The message format did not have strong delimiters, so if we used
a naïve read of so many bytes, we'd run the risk of reading
an entire message but blocking until a few more bytes <i>of the next message</i>
were read to fill our request. This could lead to getting "out of sync"
with the sensor.
</dd>

<dd>
By setting <b>VMIN</b>/<b>VTIME</b> properly, we were able to insure that
that we could efficiently capture all the data sent in one burst without
risk of inter-message overlap.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
We'll note that some of these timeout issues can be partly addressed
by the use of signals and alarms, but this is really a substandard
solution: signals and I/O are hard to get right (especially in a
portable manner), and we very strongly prefer using the features of
the line-discipline code as they were intended. Signals suck.
</p>

<h1>When does <u>read()</u> return?</h1>

<p>
The <b>termios</b> settings are actually handled in the kernel, and
the ones we're interested in are in the <i>line discipline</i> code.
This sits above the "device driver", and this is consistent with our
applying termios to both serial and network I/O (which obviously
use different underlying hardware).
</p>

<p>
All of the <b>VMIN</b> and <b>VTIME</b> areas involve one question:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>When does the line driver allow <b>read()</b> to return?</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
With a "regular file", the operating system returns from the
<b>read()</b> system call when either the user buffer is full, or
when the end of file has been reached - this decision is easy
and automatic.
</p>

<p>
But when the driver is reading from a terminal line, the "Are we done?"
question can be asked over and over for each character that arrives.
This question is resolved by setting <b>VMIN</b>/<b>VTIME</b>.
</p>

<p>
Using our temperature-sensor example, we'll list the requirements
that inform our design:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  We normally read up to 20 bytes as a "message"
</li>
<li>
  Individual messages have their bytes all sent together
</li>
<li>
  No background processing required; while waiting for input,
  we're happy to block indefinitely waiting for something to happen
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The last requirement means that we have no <i>overall</i> timeout, but
we do have an <i>intercharacter</i> timeout. This is the key functionality
provided by the line driver. Let's be specific.
</p>

<p>
When waiting for input, the driver returns when:
</p>

<dl class="defnlist">
<dt> <b>VTIME</b> tenths of a second elapses <i>between</i> bytes</dt>
<dd>
An internal timer is started when a character arrives, and it counts
up in tenths of a second units. It's reset whenever new data arrives, so
rapidly-arriving data never gives the intercharacter timer a chance to
count very high.
</dd>

<dd>
It's only after the <i>last</i> character of a burst — when the line is
quiet — that the timer really gets counting. When it reaches <b>VTIME</b>
tenths, the user's request has been satisfied and the <b>read()</b> returns.
</dd>

<dd>
This provides exactly the behavior we want when dealing with bursty data:
collect data while it's arriving rapidly, but when it calms down,
give us what you got.
</dd>

<dt><b>VMIN</b> characters have been received, with no more data available</dt>
<dd>
At first this appears duplicative to the <b>nbytes</b> parameter to the
<b>read()</b> system call, but it's not quite the same thing.
</dd>

<dd>
The serial driver maintains an input queue of data received but not
transferred to the user — clearly data can arrive even when we're not
asking for it — and this is always first copied to the user's buffer
on a <b>read()</b> without having to wait for anything.
</dd>

<dd>
But if we do end up blocking for I/O (because the kernel's input
queue is empty), then <b>VMIN</b> kicks in: When that many bytes
have been received, the <b>read()</b> request returns that data. In
this respect we can think of the <b>nbytes</b> parameter as being the amount of
data we <i>hope</i> to get, but we'll settle for <b>VMIN</b>.
</dd>

<dt>The user's requested number of bytes has been satisfied</dt>
<dd>
This rule trumps all the others: there is no circumstance where the
system will provide <i>more</i> data than was actually asked for by the
user. If the user asks for (say) ten bytes in the <b>read()</b>
system call, and that much data is already waiting in the kernel's
input queue, then it's returned to the caller immediately and without
having <b>VMIN</b> and <b>VTIME</b> participate in any way.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
These are certainly confusing to one who is new to <b>termios</b>, but
it's not really poorly defined Instead, they solve problems that are
not obvious to the newcomer. It's only when one is actually dealing
with terminal I/O and running into issues of either performance or
timing that one really must dig in.
</p>

<h1>VMIN and VTIME defined</h1>

<p>
<b>VMIN</b> is a character count ranging from 0 to 255 characters, and
<b>VTIME</b> is time measured in 0.1 second intervals, (0 to 25.5 seconds).
The value of "zero" is special to both of these parameters, and this suggests
four combinations that we'll discuss below. In every case, the question
is when a <b>read()</b> system call is satisfied, and this is our prototype call:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">int n = read(fd, buffer, nbytes);
</pre>

<p>
Keep in mind that the tty driver maintains an input queue of bytes
already read from the serial line and not passed to the user, so not
every <b>read()</b> call waits for actual I/O - the read may very well be
satisfied directly from the input queue.
</p>

<dl class="defnlist">
<dt>VMIN = 0 and VTIME = 0</dt>
<dd>
This is a completely non-blocking read - the call is satisfied immediately
directly from the driver's input queue. If data are available, it's
transferred to the caller's buffer up to nbytes and returned. Otherwise
zero is immediately returned to indicate "no data".  We'll note that this
is "polling" of the serial port, and it's almost always a bad idea. If
done repeatedly, it can consume enormous amounts of processor time and
is highly inefficient. Don't use this mode unless you really, really
know what you're doing.
</dd>

<dt> VMIN = 0 and VTIME &gt; 0 </dt>
<dd>
This is a pure timed read. If data are available in the input queue,
it's transferred to the caller's buffer up to a maximum of nbytes, and
returned immediately to the caller. Otherwise the driver blocks until data
arrives, or when VTIME tenths expire from the start of the call. If the
timer expires without data, zero is returned. A single byte is sufficient
to satisfy this read call, but if more is available in the input queue,
it's returned to the caller. Note that this is an <i>overall</i> timer,
not an <i>intercharacter</i> one.
</dd>

<dt>VMIN &gt; 0 and VTIME &gt; 0</dt>
<dd>
A <b>read()</b> is satisfied when either VMIN characters have been transferred to
the caller's buffer, or when VTIME tenths expire between characters. Since
this timer is not started until the first character arrives, this call
can block indefinitely if the serial line is idle. This is the most
common mode of operation, and we consider VTIME to be an <i>intercharacter</i>
timeout, not an <i>overall</i> one. This call should never return zero bytes
read.
</dd>

<dt> VMIN &gt; 0 and VTIME = 0 </dt>
<dd>
This is a counted read that is satisfied only when at least VMIN
characters have been transferred to the caller's buffer - there is no
timing component involved. This read can be satisfied from the driver's
input queue (where the call could return immediately), or by waiting for
new data to arrive: in this respect the call could block indefinitely. We
believe that it's undefined behavior if nbytes is less then VMIN.
