Notes for native compile of DAP project

Install compiler and make on the target:
sudo apt-get install build-essential

Copy dapterm project to target (work out of the root)
Recommend do a clean before a copy.
Alternatively, you could replace this step with a git clone to get the repo and then do git pull to update as needed
scp -r ~/Projects/dapterm root@192.168.20.54:~/
